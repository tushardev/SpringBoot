For Many to Many relationship
We have added @JoinTable annotation in Musician class and reference in CD table using mapped by.

We can do the reverse as well - add @JoinTable annotation in CD table and reference in Musician table using mapped by.


For One To Many relation:
The entity which has @JoinColumn annotation is owner of the relationship and other side used mapped by for reference.
